type Addable = interface {
    fn + (other: Addable) -> Addable
    fn -(other: Addable) -> Addable
}

type Comparable = interface {
    fn < (other: Comparable) -> bool
    fn > (other: Comparable) -> bool
}

type Numeric = interface Addable, Comparable {
    fn *(other: Numeric) -> Numeric
    fn /(other: Numeric) -> Numeric
}

fn calculate<T: Numeric>(x: T, y: T, z: T) -> Numeric {
    // Should resolve all operators through Numeric constraint
    let sum: Numeric = x + y
    let product: Numeric = sum * z
    if product > x {
        return product / z
    }
    return x - y
}


I get:

Cannot infer common type: found Numeric, T: Numerictype-c(TCE040)

From both the returns of the function ... any clue why?
