# About
Type-C is a general purpose programming language that is designed to be a safe and fast language for application level programming.

# Language Features
- Static typing with type inference
- Generics with constraints
- Classes and interfaces with inheritance
- Variant types (algebraic data types) with pattern matching
- Coroutines (generator-like constructs)
- FFI declarations for external libraries
- Namespaces for code organization
- Multiple destructuring patterns
- Operator overloading via method names

# Type System

Type-C supports a lot of data types:

- Primitive Types: Basic types such as bool, u32, f64, etc.
- Structs: Structured types that group together other types.
- Enums: Enumerated types that can hold one of several values.
- Variants: Variants, also known as algebraic data types, that can hold one of several types, with constructors.
- Arrays: Arrays, a collection of elements of the same type.
- Functions: Functions as data types, since Type-C supports first-class functions, functions need to be typed as well.
- Interfaces: Interfaces, the basic building blocks of interface-oriented programming in type-c. Defines a set of methods that a class must implement.
- Classes: Classes, a subset of object-oriented programming in type-c.
- Implementations: Implementations, a group of methods that a class can reuse
- Tuples: Tuples, a type that can hold a fixed number of elements of different types. Though it is only used for function return types and unpacking those values.
- Nullables: Nullables, a type that can hold either a value or null.
- `ReturnType<T>`: A type that can hold a return value of a function.
